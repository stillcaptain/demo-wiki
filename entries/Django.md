# Django

Django is a high-level [Python](/wiki/Python) web framework that enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It is designed to make it easier to build complex, data-driven web applications by providing a clean and pragmatic design. Developed by a fast-paced, experienced team, Django focuses on automating as much as possible while maintaining flexibility.


### History

Django was originally developed in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper in Kansas, USA. It was created as a response to the need for a framework that could handle complex, database-driven sites with speed. It was released publicly as open-source software in 2005.


### Key Features of Django
1. MVC architecture: Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. In this architecture, the Model represents the data, the View handles the presentation, and the Controller manages the logic. Django uses the term “MTV” (Model-Template-View) instead of MVC.

2. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Django includes a powerful ORM that allows developers to interact with the database using Python code rather than SQL queries. This simplifies database operations and ensures that developers can write database queries using Python objects.

3. Security Features: Django comes with built-in security features such as preventing SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The framework also includes tools to manage user authentication and permissions.


### Django and the Web Development Ecosystem
Django is part of the Python web framework ecosystem, and its tight integration with Python allows developers to create dynamic and data-driven websites quickly. It is widely used for projects such as social networks, content management systems (CMS), and APIs. Django is also commonly paired with [CSS](/wiki/CSS) to handle the frontend styles of web applications.
